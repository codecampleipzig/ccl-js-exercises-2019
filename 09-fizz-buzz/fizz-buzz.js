# Fizz Buzz Instructions

Write a program to print out all the numbers from 1 to 100 with two exceptions.
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instaed.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5
